            "<b>2 (Casual)</b> - These packs are where you want to start as a begginer. If the packs on the first level are designed for experts to relax, these are specifically target towards newcomers. 50-200 hours to complete. The 1.16.5 pack most closly resembling this difficulty is Create: Above and Beyond.",
            "<b>3 (Expert)</b> - The golden mean of modpack difficulties. Some gregic elements start to show and you'll need dedication to complete one of these. 200-500 hours of your free time are required. Enigmatica 2 Expert is probably the most popular example.",
            "<b>4 (Professional)</b> - Things get hard here. You can play these without any experience but there's a high chance you are going to have a bad time. You need around 500 hours to get to the end, this can be caused by hard to understand technology or unbearable hardcore mods - like RLCraft.",
