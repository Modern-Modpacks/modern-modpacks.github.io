One of those will take you about 2-5 hours of in-game time.","<b>2 (Casual)</b> - These packs are where you want to start as a begginer. If the packs on the first level are designed for experts to relax, these are specifically target towards newcomers. 10-50 hours to complete.","<b>3 (Expert)</b> - The golden mean of modpack difficulties. Some gregic elements start to show and you'll need dedication to complete one of these. 100-500 hours of your free time are required.","<b>4 (Professional)</b> - Things get hard here. You can play these without any experience but there's a high chance you are going to have a bad time. You need around 1000 hours to get to the end.","<b>5 (Gregic)</b> - Welcome to hell!
