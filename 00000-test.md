# To be fair

You have to have a **VERY HIGH** IQ to understand *Rick and Morty*. The humor is extremely ~~subtle~~, and without a solid grasp of `theoretical physics` most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.

## There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook

Which is deftly woven into his characterisation - 
1. His personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. 
2. The fans understand this stuff;
3. They have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. 

### As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots[^1]

[^1]: Of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in [Rick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)'s existencial catchphrase 

> "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub"

Which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons 
```

#### I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

What fools...
: how I pity them. :joy:

##### *And yes by the way*

- I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. 
- And no, **you cannot see it.** 
* It's for the ladies' eyes only- 
* And even they have to *demonstrate* that they're within ^5^ IQ points of my own ~(preferably lower)~ beforehand.
